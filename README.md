# TorZillaPrint

TorZillaPrint (TZP) aims to provide a comprehensive, all-in-one, fingerprinting test suite, nicely broken into suitable sections with relevant information together. Long term, the goal is to collect fingerprint data (no PII, and from Firefox and Tor Browser only), so as to analyze that data to see how many classifications each metric or section provides

### ðŸŸª  What we do care about:
- Current Tor Browser and Firefox ESR or higher
- Tor Uplift, FuzzyFox, Fusion
- Comparing Tor Browser with Firefox
- First party only (for now)
- Lowering entropy (or poison pills where appropriate)
- Help. We'll take all the help we can get.

### ðŸŸ©  What we might care about:
- Collecting data via submissions
- Expanding to include tests that require third parties
- Additional test pages for specific things

### ðŸŸ§  What we don't care about:
- Other browsers
- Extensions (except those used in Tor Browser if they affect tests)
- Providing entropy figures

### ðŸŸ¥  Acknowledgments
